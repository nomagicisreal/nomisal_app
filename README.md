# nomisal_app
nomisal_app is a library on [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_app) It’s an application for me, nomisal, to analyze the whole world, to build a social media application in the future. I know publishing such a personal use case as a library seems inappropriate; but by doing this, I don’t think I can build the social media in a clean way.

## Why nomisal_app? What am I trying to build?
Basically, If you are interested in building a social media application, 
and you also favor my views and definitions helping myself to build my application, maybe this library can help you, too? 
In the future, someday, maybe you can see `/lib/introduction.md` written in Chinese to know more details about nomisal_app.

I’m a Taiwanese, English is not my native language, 
so I have trouble diving deep into every discussion on relative topics; though, 
it is certain that I want to have some design thinking. 
I hope that I will be able to write and talk about my design thinking in English someday, but not now.

## What nomisal_app for?
Ideally, I’m trying to find a balance between 1 and 2.
- Let nomisal_app be a project that really helps me explore the possibility of application.
- Let nomisal_app be a project that really prevents me from overengineering.

Practically, it is a project trying to decompose the world, containing 3 sub-projects, 
Dreami, Lovi, Govi; Each of them has a unique way to inspect the user's data — {Dreami:entity, Lovi:model, Govi:data}.
Take a noun, book, for example, in Dreami, we can call it as “entity”; in Lovi, we can call it as “model”; in Govi, we can call it as “data”. Not only books, every noun can be interpreted as ’entity, model, data’, reflecting ‘subjective, objective, social perspective’ to have deep discussion within each of sub-projects. 
This three classification helps me think about how an object interacts with the user.\

Again, it’s hard for me to have a deeper discussion in English for now. 
If you want to learn more about this library, plz see ‘/lib/introduction.md’. 
Overall, with nomisal_app, it’s practical for me to visualize ideas, prototype ui, consider user behavior, 
and more. Notice that the visualization definition is in [nomisal_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_ui) and the public relationship or consideration about project structure is in [nomisal_res](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_res).
