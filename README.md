An application for nomisal to analyze all the entities/data/models in the world.

I'm try to decompose the world into three kinds of data type: entity, data, model.
Although the actual difference between 'entity', 'data', 'model' are not clear enough for now,
it's certain for now that I will try to condense the world into `entity`, `data`, `model`,
which provides me a way to view from `user-side`, `social-side`, `otherUser-side`,
those meaning are different things according to user-self.

Before run into the discussion of how the difference they are,
At first, maybe I should try composing the world in my native language, Chinese ?
Before then, I will consider all the data in a convenient way: `identity`, `identity-not`
